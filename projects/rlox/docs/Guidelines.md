1.  **Start with the Basics:** Begin with the scanning phase, get it rock solid, then move to parsing, and finally evaluation. Follow the book's structure.

2.  **Write Tests:** Before you implement a feature, write tests for it (or as you implement it, if test-first is too strict). This will help you understand the feature's requirements and ensure it works correctly.

3.  **Refactor Regularly:** As you add features, revisit your code. Look for opportunities to simplify, improve clarity, and eliminate duplication. Don't be afraid to refactor.

4.  **Embrace the Learning Process:** Don't be discouraged if some concepts or patterns are unfamiliar. Take the time to understand them. This is a learning experience.

5. **Don't get bogged down in premature optimization.** Make it work, make it right, *then* (if needed) make it fast. The emphasis here is on a working, understandable interpreter.

In short, your approach should be methodical, incremental, test-driven, and focused on clarity. You're building a solid foundation, one step at a time, and learning new techniques along the way.
