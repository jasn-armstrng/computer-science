The properties of the non-abstract implementation of an idea are as good a guide for extensions as that of the abstract conceptualization of it. ... Go back and forth between those worlds! ... Tons of potential ideas *die* with every object-oriented / functional added layer of indirection.

Francois Fleuret's statement is emphasizing an important principle in research, software engineering, and design: **balancing abstraction with concrete implementation**. Let’s break it down in simpler terms.

#### 1. **Two Worlds: Abstract vs. Concrete Implementation**
   - The **abstract conceptualization** of an idea refers to the high-level, theoretical understanding of it. This includes mathematical models, algorithms, object-oriented/functional programming paradigms, or formal logical descriptions.
   - The **non-abstract implementation** refers to how the idea materializes in practice—real-world code, hardware constraints, performance bottlenecks, and interactions with an actual system.

   His advice: **don’t stay stuck in one world; move between them**. Both perspectives provide valuable insights.

#### 2. **Why Both Matter?**
   - The abstract formulation helps in **generalizing** an idea, making it modular, reusable, and theoretically sound.
   - The concrete implementation reveals **hidden constraints**, inefficiencies, and real-world performance issues.

   **Example:**
   If you’re designing a memory allocator for a programming language:
   - **Abstract perspective** might suggest a beautifully recursive garbage collector.
   - **Concrete implementation** might reveal that the CPU cache behavior and memory fragmentation make it perform terribly.

   If you get stuck only in the abstract world, you risk making something elegant but impractical. If you focus only on the concrete, you risk making something brittle and hard to extend.

#### 3. **The Risk of Too Many Layers of Indirection**
   - Object-oriented and functional programming often encourage **abstraction through layers of indirection** (e.g., interfaces, dependency injection, monads).
   - While these help with maintainability and modularity, **every added layer distances you from the core behavior** of the system.
   - **Too much abstraction can obscure how things actually work, killing potential optimizations and creative extensions**.

   **Example:**
   - Consider a deep learning framework with multiple layers of abstraction. A researcher tweaking a neural network might struggle to **truly understand the low-level GPU memory access patterns**, which could unlock significant speed improvements.
   - Or in a large object-oriented codebase, a simple feature change might require navigating through **ten levels of inheritance and virtual method calls**, making it difficult to see the actual computation path.

#### 4. **The Takeaway: Be Pragmatic**
   - Don't be dogmatic about abstraction. Use it wisely, but always check back with reality.
   - Move **back and forth** between **conceptual elegance** and **practical execution**.
   - Avoid excessive abstraction if it **hides performance or structural insights**.

This principle applies broadly—not just in software, but in **AI, physics, mathematics, and engineering**.
