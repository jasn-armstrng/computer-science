### Data structures

When the data model of the language in which we are writing a program lacks a built-in representation for the data model of the problem at hand, we must represent the needed data model using the abstractions supported by the language. For this purpose, we study data structures, which are methods for representing in the data model of a programming language abstractions that are not an explicit part of that language. Different programming languages may have strikingly different data models. For example, unlike C, the language Lisp supports trees directly, and the language Prolog has logic built into its data model.
