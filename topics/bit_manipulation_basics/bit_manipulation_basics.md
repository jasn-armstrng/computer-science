##### Introduction:
Working on bytes, or data types comprising of bytes like ints, floats, doubles or even datastructures which stores large amount of bytes is normal for a programmer. In some cases, a programmer needs to go beyond this - that is to say that in a deeper level where the importance of bits is realized.



##### Bitwise Operators:
There are different bitwise operations used in the bit manipulation. These bit operations operate on the individual bits of the bit patterns. Bit operations are fast and can be used in optimizing time complexity. Some common bit operators are:

1. **NOT ( ~ ):** Bitwise NOT is an unary operator that flips the bits of the number i.e., if the ith bit is 0, it will change it to 1 and vice versa. Bitwise NOT is nothing but simply the oneâ€™s complement of a number.
    **Example 1:**
    ``` Rust
    let n: u8 = 0b101;  // The binary representation of 5. The full representation for this as a u8 would be 00000101
                        // but the leftmost zeros are truncated when printed. See inline comments at printlns below.
    let bit_mask: u8 = 0b111;  // Introduce a 3-bit mask to limit the operation to 3 bits.
    let not_n = !n & bit_mask;  // Apply NOT, then mask to limit to 3 bits. If no mask was applied then Rust would
                                    // by default returns 11111010 where we see the remainder of the types' leftnmost
                                    // bits flipped.
    println!(" N = {:b}", n);  // binary 101, decimal 5
    println!("!N = 0{:b}", not_n);  // After applying Bitwise NOT: binary 10, decimal 2
    // In the above !n is evaluated as
    // 101 |
    // 101      Each element of the top row is logically compared with its correspondence in the row below.
    // ----
    // 010      // !(1 & 1) = 0, !(0 & 0) = 1, !(1 & 1) = 0,
    // ----
    ```


2. **AND ( & ):** Bitwise AND is a binary operator that operates on two equal-length bit patterns. If both bits in the compared position of the bit patterns are 1, the bit in the resulting bit pattern is 1, otherwise 0.
    **Example 1:**
    ```Rust
    let a: u8 = 0b101;  // 5
    let b: u8 = 0b011;  // 3
    println!("{:b} & 0{:b} = {:b}", a, b, a & b);  // 1
    // In the above a & b is evaluated as
    // 101 &
    // 011      Each element of the top row is logically compared with its correspondence in the row below.
    // ----
    // 001
    // ----
    ```

3. **OR ( | ):** Bitwise OR is also a binary operator that operates on two equal-length bit patterns, similar to bitwise AND. If both bits in the compared position of the bit patterns are 0, the bit in the resulting bit pattern is 0, otherwise 1.
    **Example 1:**
    ```Rust
    let c: u8 = 0b101;  // 5
    let d: u8 = 0b011;  // 3
    println!("{:b} | 0{:b} = {:b}", c, d, c | d);  // 7
    // In the above c | d is evaluated as
    // 101 |
    // 011      Each element of the top row is boolean campared with its correspondence in the row below.
    // ----
    // 111
    // ----
    ```

4. **XOR ( ^ ):** Bitwise XOR also takes two equal-length bit patterns. If both bits in the compared position of the bit patterns are 0 or 1, the bit in the resulting bit pattern is 0, otherwise 1.
    **Example 1:**
    ```Rust
    println!("Bitwise XOR:");
    let e: u8 = 0b101;  // 5
    let f: u8 = 0b011;  // 3
    println!("{:b} ^ 0{:b} = {:b}", e, f, e ^ f);  // 6
    // In the above e ^ f is evaluated as
    // 101 ^
    // 011
    // ----
    // 110
    // ----
    ```

5. **Left Shift ( << ):** Left shift operator is a binary operator which shifts some number of bits, in the given bit pattern, to the left and appends 0 at the end. Left shift is equivalent tomultiplying the bit pattern with 2^k ( if we are shifting k bits )
    **Example 1:**
    ```Rust
    let g: u32 = 0b001;  // 1 * 2^0 = 1
    let h: u32 = 2;      //
    match g.checked_shl(h) {
        Some(result) => println!("{:b} << {:b} = {:b}", g, h, result),  // 0100 or 4
        None => println!("Overflow detected!")   // 48, or 110000
    }
    // In the above g << h is evaluated as
    // move 1 in 0b001 to the left 2 places
    ```
    **Example 2:**
    ```Rust
    let i: u32 = 0b00001;  // 1 * 2^1 = 2
    let j: u32 = 0b11000;  // (1 * 2^3) + (1 * 2^4) = 24, or k
    match i.checked_shl(j) {
        Some(result) => println!("0000{:b} << 0{:b} = {:b}", i, j, result),
        None => println!("Overflow detected!")
    }
    // In the above i << j is evaluated as
    // move 1 in 0b00001 to the left 24 places giving us 1000000000000000000000000
    ```
    **Example 3:**
    ```Rust
    let k: u32 = 0b000110;  // 2^1 + 2^2 = 6
    let l: u32 = 16;
    match k.checked_shl(l) {
        Some(result) => println!("{:b} << {} = {:b}", k, l, result),
        None => println!("Overflow detected!")
    }
    // In the above k << l is evaluated as
    // move 1 in 0b000110 to the left 16 places giving us 1100000000000000000
    //                                                      <-------------
    //                                                                    110
    ```

    **Note:** Shifting (<<, >>) is often faster than INTEGER multiplication and division, especially for powers of 2, due to its simplicity and direct support in hardware.
    **Example 1:**
    ```Rust
    let x: u32 = 0b101;  // or 5
    let x_by_8: u32 = x << 3;  // or, x * 2^3, or shift 101 to the left 3 times
    println!("{}, {:b}", x_by_8, x_by_8);  // 40, or 101000
    ```

6. **Right Shift ( >> ):** Right shift operator is a binary operator which shift  number of bits, in the given bit pattern, to the right and append 1 at the end. Right shift is equivalent to dividing the bit pattern with 2k ( if we are shifting k bits ).
    **Example 1:**
    ```Rust
    println!("Right Shift:");
    let o: u32 = 0b100;  // 1 * 2^2 = 4
    let p: u32 = 2;
    match o.checked_shr(p) {
        Some(result) => println!("{:b} >> 0{:b} = {:b}", o, p, result),  // 0100 or 4
        None => println!("Overflow detected!")   // 48, or 110000
    }
    // In the above o >> p is evaluated as
    // move o 2 places to the right

    // Note: Shifting too far right in Rust does not cause a wrap-around. Instead, Rust truncates the value to 0 if the
    // shift amount exceeds or equals the bit width of the type. This behavior applies to both signed and unsigned integers.
    ```

##### Bitwise Operations Evaluations
| X        | Y        | X & Y    | X \| Y   | X ^ Y    | !(X)     |
| :------: | :------: | :------: | :------: | :------: | :------: |
| 0        |   0      | 0        | 0        | 0        | 1        |
| 0        |   1      | 0        | 1        | 1        | 1        |
| 1        |   0      | 0        | 1        | 1        | 0        |
| 1        |   1      | 1        | 1        | 0        | 0        |

Bitwise operators are good for saving space and sometimes to cleverly remove dependencies.
